It's Tetris, for the t84ce. Programmed in ez80.

Controls:
2nd/Alpha - rotate
Left/Right- move
Down - soft drop
Up -hard drop (instant drop)
XT0N - hold piece
Del - quit

Known issues: Rotation will sometimes raise your piece up dramatically. This is currently left in as a 'feature' until I figure out why it's happening - it does give you more flexibility and survivability.
