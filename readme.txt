It's Tetris, for the t84ce. Programmed in ez80.

Controls:
2nd/Alpha - rotate left/right
Left/Right- move
Down - soft drop
Up -hard drop (instant drop)
XT0N - hold piece
Del - quit

Known issues:
 Rotating right will sometimes cause the program to exit? Might be related to how I'm checking key input.
 Can't see upcoming pieces yet
 No lose condition, yet...
